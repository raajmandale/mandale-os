# What is M-OS

M-OS is a **pattern-based runtime architecture** designed to execute computational workflows as **Pattern State Transition Graphs (PSTG)**.

Instead of imperative code pipelines, M-OS treats computation as **structured execution patterns**.

This enables:

• deterministic runtime execution  
• hardware-agnostic compute routing  
• reproducible AI / HPC workflows  
• structured optimization pipelines

# Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/svg/mos_architecture.svg" width="900">
</p>

M-OS runtime is composed of five core layers:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| PatternGraph | Describes computation as patterns |
| Runtime | Executes graph nodes |
| Scheduler | Determines execution order |
| Adapter | Connects runtime to compute backend |
| Backend | CPU / OpenCL / AI execution |

---

# Pattern Graph Example

<p align="center">

</p>

Execution model:


Transform → Search → Optimize → Simulate → Aggregate


Each stage becomes a **node in the PatternGraph**.

# Execution Flow

Execution pipeline:

Scheduler

# Quick Demo

Example workflow:

```bash
mos run examples/graph_opt.yaml

Expected output:

PatternGraph loaded
Nodes: 12
Execution backend: CPU

Running scheduler...

Why M-OS

Traditional compute systems are:

imperative
hardware-specific
difficult to reproduce

M-OS introduces:

pattern-driven execution
deterministic runtime graphs
portable compute routing

This enables reproducible HPC / AI / optimization workloads.

Roadmap

Current version:

v0 — Pattern Runtime Core

Next stages:

v1 — distributed scheduler
v2 — GPU routing
v3 — AI backend adapters
v4 — hybrid compute orchestration
Status

Research prototype.

Architecture locked under M-OS v0 baseline.

# Why this layout is powerful

It follows the **top research repo pattern**:

1️⃣ **Hero diagram first**  
2️⃣ **Clear system definition**  
3️⃣ **Architecture diagram**  
4️⃣ **Execution model**  
5️⃣ **CLI demo**  
6️⃣ **Project structure**

This is exactly how **serious engineering repos look**.

---

# Brutal CTO advice

Right now your repo is **technically correct but emotionally flat**.

Add **three visual elements** and it becomes impressive:

1️⃣ Hero system diagram  
2️⃣ Architecture diagram  
3️⃣ Execution flow

You already created those SVGs — good move.

If you want, I can also show you **the secret trick that makes GitHub repos go viral** in engineering communities (it’s not code).
